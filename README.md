Karbonite
=========

I submit for your perusal Karbonite (KaO3). A newly discovered mineral that has hydrocarbon-like properties and is perfect for processing into a fuel. It's easily mined from the surface, and can be found in liquid or gaseous forms on certain planets (Jool cloud harvesters anyone?)

Karbonite's goal is to provide a permissively licensed, community driven ISRU (in situ resource utilization) framework for KSP. 

Karbonite is based on (and in some cases, extends) the Open Resource System (already familiar to folks who use KSP-I, and MKS/OKS) and combines it with new code, some amazing community driven parts, and a license that encourages sharing and extension.

There is also a [forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/87335).
